Recently, a colleague wanted a way to search the body of Windows eventlogs â€“ for instance if you wanted to count the occurances of a certain type of event where the traditional filtering fields are unable to differentiate between events.

The powershell cmdlet `Get-WinEvent` output can be piped into `where-object` to provide a set of events filtered by the search term in the eventlog body.
 
```powershell
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{logname='application'; ProviderName='ASP.NET 4.0.30319.0'} | where-object  { $_.Message -like '*The timeout period elapsed prior to obtaining a connection from the pool*' }
```

Thanks Matt.
