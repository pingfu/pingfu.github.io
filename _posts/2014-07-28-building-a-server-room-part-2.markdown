*This is the second post in a [five part series of posts]({% post_url 2014-07-23-building-a-server-room-part-1 %}) chronologically documenting the build and fit of a new comms room.*

Physical access to the office was not possible during the initial phase of designing the the comms room due to construction work, so the initial set of plans I drew up were based on the accuracy of the supplied drawings. I expected some discrepancies, and three days after we first gain access we've made an amendment to the route planned for the cable run into the comms room (the drawings we had pre-dated the installation of the under floor heating pipes).

We've laid matting along the new route for the cables, and the cabinets have been moved into position in the comms room, and building materials for the hard fit are starting to arrive.

		<p><code>Photo 1</code> The cable matting is down. Cat5e patch cables will follow this route to reach the comms room encountering as little "pipe resistance" as possible. The decision to use cat5e from floor ports to patch panels (as opposed to Cat6) was a difficult cost-benefit vs future proofing compromise, but retrospectively, the bandwidth and throughput is ample.</p>

		<p><code>Photo 2</code> Pipes, cable basket and ducting are tucked away under the raised floor with 11cm of clearance. This is a better angle to appreciate just how little space there is under the floor. The clearance is poor considering we will run 300~ cat5E cables into a comms cabinet from the floor ports. The alternative path for the cabling into the comms room means we don't need to adjustment the height of the floor however, we'll take that basket and ducting out.</p>

		<p><code>Photo 3</code> The area directly outside the comms room entrance provides access to two riser cupboards, mechanical on the left, and electrical on the right. The fibre was installed to existing cable basket in the electrical riser, and delivers dedicated capacity underneath the raised floor into cabinet 3. I've also had tie lines installed between the plant room on the ground flood and the comms room for ADSL, POTS fax and some extra capacity for future proofing (despite the business using a pure VoIP PBX and SIP trunks for telephony). The tie-lines follow the same route as the fibre into the comms room.</p>

		<p><code>Photo 7</code> We're running cat5e into the comms room at a right angle to avoid the piping. The majority of the cabling will terminate in the right-most cabinet, cabinet 3 (not in position in this picture). The first two cabinets (to the left of the picture) will house server infrastructure and patch back into the comms cabinet (cab 3).</p>
