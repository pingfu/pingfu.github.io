ASPX in-page expressions, which are nearly impossible to search for information on thanks to their tiny size and obscure-to-search-engines character selection if you don't know what to call this group of expressions. Some search friendly terms that can help bridge that divide are:

* less than percent hash
* less than percent equals
* in-page expressions
* data binding
* data bound
* bee strings
* asp.net server tags
* code render blocks

For anybody lucky enough to uncover this page then, here's an explanation of the what and the why behind <%$, <%@, <%=, <%# and so on:

* `<% %>` is for inline code (especially logic flow)
* `<%$ %>` is for evaluating expressions (like resource variables)
* `<%@ %>` is for Page directives, registering assemblies, importing namespaces, etc.
* `<%= %>` is short-hand for Response.Write (discussed here)
* `<%# %>` is used for data binding expressions.
* `<%: %>` is short-hand for Response.Write(Server.HTMLEncode()) ASP.net 4.0+
* `<%-- --%>` is for server-side comments
