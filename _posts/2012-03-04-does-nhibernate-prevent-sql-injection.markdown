No. NHibernate can be used to execute dynamic SQL statements built with user input designed to modify the statementâ€™s original meaning, or to execute arbitrary commands, but it depends on how you use it.

Be careful using `.CreateSQLQuery()`, if it is not parameterised then as you should expect - it's vulnerable to injection.

```csharp
var userName = "' or ''='"; // injection
var query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE userName = '" + userName + "'";
var names = Session.CreateSQLQuery(query).List();
```

So, parametrise it:

```csharp
var userName = "' or ''='";
var query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE userName = :userName";
query.SetString("userName", userName);
var names = Session.CreateSQLQuery(query).List();
```

A little bit of effort can go a long way.
