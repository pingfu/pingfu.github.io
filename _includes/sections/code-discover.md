# Discover

I keep a list of (arguably less well-known) projects of exceptional quality I've usually discovered lurking on Hacker News, listed here for future reference.

* ## [hangfire.io](http://hangfire.io/)
 An embeddable c# library which provides an easy, reliable and flexible interface to manage and perform background task processing, without Windows Service or separate process.

* ## [Amazon Web Services â€” a practical guide](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws) 
 A direct, trustworthy and practical guide for engineers who use the AWS stack, with tips, gotchas, information and recommendations.
            
* ## [The Tewlve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/) 
 A simple methodology for building software-as-a-service apps.
 
* ## [Shout-IRC](http://shout-irc.com/) 
 Gorgeous self-hosted IRC web client.

* ## [Scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/) 
A fantastically capable tool for crafting packets by hand.

* ## [takezoe/gitbucket](https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket) 
 A Github clone written in Scala. Perfect for a private Git repository on a low cost DigitalOcean or AWS server. The primary developer, Naoki Takezoe, places a strong emphasis on ease of installation which I absolutely love.
 
* ## [Mongoose](https://cesanta.com/mongoose.shtml) 
  A powerful asynchronous, non-blocking web server designed for use in embedded systems. Supports CGI, SSL, Digest auth, Websocket, WebDAV, Resumed download, URL rewrite, file blacklist, IP-based ACL, and available as a [single file](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/blob/master/mongoose.c).
  
* ## [Fenix](http://fenixwebserver.com/) 
 Another webserver, desktop based and designed to serve static content.
 
 * ## [darkhttpd](http://unix4lyfe.org/darkhttpd/) 
  Also available as a single file - darkhttpd has a simpler feature set compared to Mongoose, but very useful <em>"when you need a web server in a hurry.."</em>

* ## [StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/) 
 A simple daemon for stats aggregation, part of the Etsy [Measure Anything, Measure Everything](http://codeascraft.com/2011/02/15/measure-anything-measure-everything/) mantra. Applications are instrumented by developers using language-specific libraries which communicate metrics to StatsD using its simple UDP protocol.

* ## [InfluxDB](http://influxdb.com/) 
 InfluxDb is a beautifully crafted open-source distributed time series database with an SQL-like query language exposed by a native HTTP API.

* ## [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) 
 A distributed, RESTful real-time search and analytics engine which wraps Apache Lucene. [Like Solr](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10213009/solr-vs-elasticsearch), but with an architecture [designed](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2271600/elasticsearch-sphinx-lucene-solr-xapian-which-fits-for-which-usage/2288211#2288211) for scalability in modern distributed environments.

* ## [Kibana](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/) 
 Kibana is a tool for graphing, searching visualising and understanding data. It's implemented as a minimalist browser based application which relies on Javascript, and HTTP APIs to interface and pull data out of Elasticsearch.
 
* ## [Google Web Starter Kit (WSK)](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit/) 
 Complementing Google's [Web Fundamentals](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/) project and inspired by [Mobile HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile/), WSK provides Google opinionated building blocks for constructing best practice aligned multi-screen applications.

* ## [dypsilon/frontend-dev-bookmarks](https://github.com/dypsilon/frontend-dev-bookmarks/) 
 Dmitriy Navrotskyy's huge list of frontend development resources. <em>"Sorted from general knowledge at the top to concrete problems at the bottom".</em>
